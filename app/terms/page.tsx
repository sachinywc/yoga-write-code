          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Yoga Write Code
          ("Yoga Write Code", "we", "us"), a web-based software service available at
          yogawritecode.com and its subdomains. By creating an account or using the service, you

      <LegalSection n="2" title="The service">

          Yoga Write Code is an AI-assisted SEO and content planning tool. The core workflow is:
          website analysis → content opportunities → topic clusters → SEO briefs → article
          outlines → drafting in an editor. Features may change over time as the product evolves.

      <LegalSection n="4" title="Accounts">

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="5" title="Billing and payments">
        <p>
          The service is currently offered without charge. If we introduce paid plans in the

        <p>
          You keep all rights to content you create in the service (drafts, edits) and to the
          website URLs you submit. You grant us a limited license to process submitted URLs and
          fetched public page content solely to operate and provide the service to you. You
          represent that you are permitted to analyze the websites you submit.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="8" title="AI-generated outputs">
        <p>
          The service uses third-party AI models (currently Amazon Bedrock) to generate analyses,
          opportunities, clusters, briefs, and outlines. Outputs are probabilistic suggestions,
          not professional, legal, or financial advice. We do not guarantee that any output will
          improve search rankings, traffic, conversions, or revenue. You are responsible for
          reviewing, editing, and validating all AI-generated content before publishing or relying
          on it.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="9" title="Intellectual property">
        <p>
          The service, including its software, design, and branding, is owned by Yoga Write Code.
          Except for your own content, nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of our
          intellectual property to you.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="10" title="Third-party services">
        <p>
          The service relies on third-party infrastructure, including Vercel (hosting), Supabase
          (database and authentication), and Amazon Web Services (AI models). Your use of the
          service is also subject to the acceptable-use policies of those providers to the extent
          applicable.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="11" title="Availability and changes">
        <p>
          We strive for high availability but do not promise uninterrupted service. We may modify,
          suspend, or discontinue features with reasonable notice where practical. Continued use
          after changes constitutes acceptance.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="12" title="Suspension and termination">
        <p>
          You may delete your projects and drafts at any time from the dashboard. We may suspend
          or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or abuse the service. Upon termination,
          your right to use the service ends; provisions that by nature survive (disclaimers,
          liability, governing law) continue to apply.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="13" title="Privacy">
        <p>
          Our handling of personal data is described in our Privacy Policy at /privacy, which is

      <LegalSection n="14" title="Disclaimers">

          non-infringement.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection n="15" title="Limitation of liability">
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental,
          special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits, revenue, data, or
          goodwill. Our total liability for any claim arising from the service is limited to the
          amount you paid us in the twelve months before the claim (currently zero).

      <LegalSection n="16" title="Indemnification">
        <p>

        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of Nepal, without regard to conflict-of-law

          We may update these Terms from time to time. We will change the "Last updated" date and,
          for material changes, provide notice in the product. Continued use after changes means
          you accept them.
